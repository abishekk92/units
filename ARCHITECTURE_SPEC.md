# UNITS Storage Architecture Specification

## Overview

This document specifies the unified object architecture for UNITS storage, where **everything is an object** with immutable controllers that define mutation rules through sandboxed execution.

## Core Principles

1. **Unified Object Model**: All entities (data, code, accounts, tokens) are UnitsObjects
2. **Controller-Based Security**: Each object has an immutable controller (kernel module) 
3. **Sandboxed Execution**: Controllers run in isolated VM environments (RISC-V, WASM, etc.)
4. **Storage Simplicity**: Single key-value store (UnitsObjectId â†’ UnitsObject)
5. **Extensible VMs**: Support for multiple VM types via pluggable executors

## Object Model

### Core Structure

```rust
/// VM types for executable objects
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum VMType {
    /// RISC-V ELF shared objects (primary implementation)
    RiscV,
    /// WebAssembly modules (future extension)
    Wasm,
    /// eBPF programs (future extension)
    Ebpf,
    /// x86_64 native code (future extension, if needed)
    Native,
}

/// Object type distinguishing data from executable objects
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum ObjectType {
    /// Data object - not executable
    Data,
    /// Executable object with specific VM type
    Executable(VMType),
}

/// Unified object structure for all UNITS entities
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct UnitsObject {
    /// Unique identifier - how object is indexed in storage
    pub id: UnitsObjectId,
    
    /// Immutable controller - defines mutation rules for this object
    /// Points to another UnitsObject with ObjectType::Executable
    pub controller_id: UnitsObjectId,
    
    /// Object type - data or executable with VM specification
    pub object_type: ObjectType,
    
    /// Object payload: ELF/WASM/eBPF bytecode or arbitrary data
    pub data: Vec<u8>,
}
```

### System Constants

```rust
/// Hardcoded system controller IDs for bootstrap and security
/// Simple hardcoded values for initial implementation simplicity
pub const SYSTEM_LOADER_ID: UnitsObjectId = UnitsObjectId::new([0; 32]);
pub const TOKEN_CONTROLLER_ID: UnitsObjectId = UnitsObjectId::new([1; 32]);
pub const ACCOUNT_CONTROLLER_ID: UnitsObjectId = UnitsObjectId::new([2; 32]);
pub const MODULE_MANAGER_ID: UnitsObjectId = UnitsObjectId::new([3; 32]);
```

### Object Types by Usage

#### Kernel Modules (Controllers)
```rust
UnitsObject {
    id: controller_id,
    controller_id: SYSTEM_LOADER_ID,           // System loader controls kernel modules
    object_type: ObjectType::Executable(VMType::RiscV),
    data: risc_v_elf_bytes,                    // RISC-V ELF shared object
}
```

#### Data Objects  
```rust
UnitsObject {
    id: data_object_id,
    controller_id: TOKEN_CONTROLLER_ID,        // Token controller manages this data
    object_type: ObjectType::Data,
    data: token_balance_data,                  // Arbitrary binary data
}
```

## Execution Model

### VM Executor Interface

```rust
/// Abstract interface for different VM types
pub trait VMExecutor: Send + Sync {
    fn vm_type(&self) -> VMType;
    
    /// Load bytecode and execute with given context
    fn load_and_execute(
        &self,
        bytecode: &[u8],
        context: &ExecutionContext,
    ) -> Result<Vec<ObjectEffect>>;
}
```

### Execution Context

```rust
/// Complete context provided to controller during execution
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ExecutionContext {
    /// The instruction being executed
    pub instruction: Instruction,
    
    /// Objects the controller can read/modify (pre-loaded from storage)
    /// Controllers can read any object but only modify objects they control
    pub objects: HashMap<UnitsObjectId, UnitsObject>,
    
    /// Current slot number
    pub slot: u64,
    
    /// Current timestamp
    pub timestamp: u64,
    
    /// Host environment variables
    pub env_vars: HashMap<String, String>,
}

impl ExecutionContext {
    /// Get objects that this controller can modify (it controls)
    pub fn writable_objects(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = (&UnitsObjectId, &UnitsObject)> {
        self.objects.iter().filter(|(_, obj)| {
            obj.controller_id == self.instruction.controller_id
        })
    }
    
    /// Get all objects (read-only + writable)
    pub fn all_objects(&self) -> &HashMap<UnitsObjectId, UnitsObject> {
        &self.objects
    }
}
```

### Controller Standard Interface

All kernel modules must implement a standard `main` entrypoint regardless of VM type:

**RISC-V Controllers:**
```c
/// Standard entrypoint - dispatches to target function based on ExecutionContext
/// Input: Serialized ExecutionContext at INPUT_BUFFER_ADDR
/// Output: Serialized Vec<ObjectEffect> at OUTPUT_BUFFER_ADDR
/// @return 0 on success, non-zero error code on failure

#define INPUT_BUFFER_ADDR  0x10000000
#define OUTPUT_BUFFER_ADDR 0x20000000
#define MAX_BUFFER_SIZE    (1024 * 1024)  // 1MB limit

int main(void) {
    // 1. Read ExecutionContext from INPUT_BUFFER_ADDR
    // 2. Parse instruction.target_function (e.g., "transfer", "mint")
    // 3. Dispatch to appropriate function handler
    // 4. Write Vec<ObjectEffect> to OUTPUT_BUFFER_ADDR
    // 5. Return 0 for success, error code for failure
}

// Example function handlers within controller:
int handle_transfer(ExecutionContext* ctx);
int handle_mint(ExecutionContext* ctx);
int handle_burn(ExecutionContext* ctx);
```

**Future VM Types:**
- **WASM**: Export `main()` function with same memory layout
- **eBPF**: Standard eBPF program structure with `main` section
- All VMs use consistent input/output buffer conventions

### Object Effects

Controllers return object state changes from instruction execution:

```rust
/// Effect of controller execution on a single object
/// Represents before/after state for one object in an instruction
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ObjectEffect {
    /// The object that was modified
    pub object_id: UnitsObjectId,
    
    /// State before instruction execution (None if object was created)
    pub before_image: Option<UnitsObject>,
    
    /// State after instruction execution (None if object was deleted)  
    pub after_image: Option<UnitsObject>,
}

impl ObjectEffect {
    /// Create new object effect
    pub fn creation(object: UnitsObject) -> Self {
        Self {
            object_id: object.id,
            before_image: None,
            after_image: Some(object),
        }
    }
    
    /// Modify existing object effect
    pub fn modification(before: UnitsObject, after: UnitsObject) -> Self {
        Self {
            object_id: after.id,
            before_image: Some(before),
            after_image: Some(after),
        }
    }
    
    /// Delete object effect
    pub fn deletion(object: UnitsObject) -> Self {
        Self {
            object_id: object.id,
            before_image: Some(object),
            after_image: None,
        }
    }
}
```

### Effect Validation Rules

All ObjectEffects are validated before applying to storage:

1. **Ownership Validation**: Controller can only modify objects it controls
   - Effect object must have `controller_id` matching the executing controller
   
2. **ID Consistency**: Effect object_id must match target object
   - `effect.object_id == effect.object.id` for all effect types
   
3. **Type Preservation**: Controllers cannot arbitrarily change object_type
   - `object_type` changes require explicit business logic validation
   - System controllers have broader privileges for type changes
   
4. **Size Limits**: Objects have maximum size constraints
   - Default: 10MB per object data payload
   - Prevents resource exhaustion attacks

### Transaction Effects

Transaction effects aggregate all object changes from a complete transaction:

```rust
/// Complete transaction effect containing all object modifications
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct TransactionEffect {
    /// The transaction that caused these effects
    pub transaction_hash: TransactionHash,
    
    /// All object effects from this transaction's instruction(s)
    pub object_effects: Vec<ObjectEffect>,
    
    /// Slot in which transaction was processed
    pub slot: u64,
    
    /// Timestamp of transaction processing
    pub timestamp: u64,
}

impl TransactionEffect {
    /// Create transaction effect from controller execution results
    pub fn from_object_effects(
        transaction_hash: TransactionHash,
        object_effects: Vec<ObjectEffect>,
        slot: u64,
        timestamp: u64,
    ) -> Self {
        Self {
            transaction_hash,
            object_effects,
            slot,
            timestamp,
        }
    }
}
```

**Relationship**:
- **ObjectEffect**: Single object's before/after state from one instruction  
- **TransactionEffect**: Complete collection of all ObjectEffects from entire transaction
- **TransactionReceipt**: Contains TransactionEffect plus proofs, attestation, and metadata

**Note**: Current implementation has `Vec<TransactionEffect>` in TransactionReceipt, but with single-controller validation, each transaction produces exactly one TransactionEffect. This aligns with future cross-controller support where multiple controllers could generate multiple TransactionEffects.

## Transaction Execution Pipeline

### Flow Overview

```
1. Transaction with Instructions arrives
2. For each Instruction:
   a. Validate controller access to target objects
   b. Load target objects from storage into ExecutionContext
   c. Load controller kernel module from storage
   d. Determine VM type from controller.object_type
   e. Execute controller.target_function in appropriate VM sandbox
   f. Controller returns Vec<ObjectEffect> for objects it modified
   g. Validate ObjectEffects: controller can only modify objects it controls
   h. Collect all ObjectEffects from instruction
3. Create TransactionEffect containing all ObjectEffects from all instructions
4. Apply object changes to storage
5. Generate proofs for modified objects  
6. Return TransactionReceipt containing TransactionEffect and proofs
```

### Multi-Instruction Transactions

A single transaction can contain multiple instructions:
- Each instruction calls a specific function in a controller kernel module
- Instructions can target different controllers (but cross-controller calls reserved for future)
- All target objects from all instructions are validated and loaded
- Each controller can read any object but only modify objects it controls

### Instruction Format

```rust
/// Transaction instruction - call into controller entrypoint with target function
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Instruction {
    /// The controller kernel module to execute
    pub controller_id: UnitsObjectId,
    
    /// Target function name within the controller (e.g., "transfer", "mint")
    pub target_function: String,
    
    /// Objects this instruction will read/modify (all objects controller needs access to)
    pub target_objects: Vec<UnitsObjectId>,
    
    /// Parameters for the specific function call
    pub params: Vec<u8>,
}
```

### Controller Access Patterns

**Read Access**: Controllers can read any object (no restrictions)
**Write Access**: Controllers can only write to objects they control

```rust
/// Validate controller access to target objects
fn validate_controller_access(instruction: &Instruction, storage: &dyn Storage) -> Result<()> {
    let controller_id = instruction.controller_id;
    
    for object_id in &instruction.target_objects {
        let object = storage.get(object_id)?;
        
        // Controllers can read any object, but can only write objects they control
        if object.controller_id != controller_id {
            // This object will be read-only for this controller
            // Write attempts will be caught during effect validation
        }
    }
    
    Ok(())
}

/// Validate that controller can only modify objects it controls
fn validate_object_effects(effects: &[ObjectEffect], controller_id: UnitsObjectId) -> Result<()> {
    for effect in effects {
        // If the object state changed, verify controller owns it
        if effect.before_image != effect.after_image {
            if let Some(after_obj) = &effect.after_image {
                if after_obj.controller_id != controller_id {
                    return Err("Controller cannot modify objects it doesn't control".into());
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## System Bootstrap

### Bootstrap Process

```
1. System starts with hardcoded SYSTEM_LOADER_ID
2. System loader is self-controlling (controller_id = SYSTEM_LOADER_ID)  
3. System loader loads other kernel modules from storage
4. Kernel modules are controlled by system loader
5. Data objects are controlled by appropriate kernel modules
```

### System Loader Responsibilities

- Parse and validate ELF files
- Load controllers into VM sandboxes
- Orchestrate controller execution
- Apply object effects to storage
- Generate transaction receipts and proofs

## VM Implementations

### RISC-V Executor (Primary)

**Implementation**: Uses `ckb-vm` crate for production-ready, sandboxed RISC-V execution with ELF support.

```rust
pub struct RiscVExecutor {
    memory_limit: usize,        // 1MB default
    instruction_limit: u64,     // Configurable limit
}

impl VMExecutor for RiscVExecutor {
    fn vm_type(&self) -> VMType { VMType::RiscV }
    
    fn load_and_execute(&self, elf_bytes: &[u8], context: &ExecutionContext) -> Result<Vec<ObjectEffect>> {
        // 1. Initialize ckb-vm machine with memory limits
        // 2. Load ELF binary into VM memory space
        // 3. Set up fixed memory buffers (INPUT_BUFFER_ADDR, OUTPUT_BUFFER_ADDR)
        // 4. Serialize ExecutionContext and write to INPUT_BUFFER_ADDR
        // 5. Call main() entrypoint with instruction limits
        // 6. Read ObjectEffects from OUTPUT_BUFFER_ADDR and deserialize
        // 7. Return effects for validation and application
    }
}
```

### Future VM Extensions

The architecture supports adding new VM types without breaking changes:

```rust
pub struct WasmExecutor { /* WASM runtime */ }
pub struct EbpfExecutor { /* eBPF runtime */ }

// Register with system loader
system_loader.register_vm_executor(VMType::Wasm, Box::new(WasmExecutor::new()));
system_loader.register_vm_executor(VMType::Ebpf, Box::new(EbpfExecutor::new()));
```

## Security Model

### Immutable Controllers
- Object's `controller_id` is set at creation and cannot be changed
- Provides security guarantee: controller logic cannot be bypassed
- Controller changes require creating new object with new controller

### Sandboxed Execution
- Controllers run in isolated VM environments
- No direct storage access - only through provided object context
- Resource limits (memory, instructions, time) enforced per execution
- All mutations captured as structured effects for validation

### System Controller Whitelist
- Hardcoded system controller IDs prevent privilege escalation
- System loader controls creation of new kernel modules
- Clear chain of trust from bootstrap to all objects

## Storage Integration

### Key-Value Mapping
```
UnitsObjectId (32 bytes) â†’ UnitsObject (serialized)
```

### Object Proof Generation
- Each object mutation generates cryptographic proof
- Proofs commit to before/after object states
- Slot-level aggregation of all object proofs
- Complete audit trail of all mutations

### Transaction Effects
```rust
pub struct TransactionEffect {
    pub transaction_hash: TransactionHash,
    pub object_id: UnitsObjectId,
    pub before_image: Option<UnitsObject>,
    pub after_image: Option<UnitsObject>,
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- New UnitsObject coexists with current ObjectType/ObjectMetadata
- Gradual migration of objects to new format
- RuntimeBackend system maintained alongside new VM executors
- Existing tests continue to pass during transition

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Unified UnitsObject struct and basic RISC-V execution
2. **Phase 2**: Complete transaction pipeline integration  
3. **Phase 3**: Attestation and advanced security features
4. **Phase 4**: Additional VM types (WASM, eBPF) and cross-controller communication

## Future Extensions

### Cross-Controller Communication
Reserved design space for future implementation:
- Remove single-controller validation
- Add controller dependency resolution
- Implement secure cross-controller call interface

### Multi-Runtime Optimization  
- Runtime detection via bytecode headers
- JIT compilation for performance-critical controllers
- Native code generation for trusted system controllers

### Distributed Execution
- Network attestation protocols
- Consensus integration for distributed object modifications
- Cross-node object effect synchronization
