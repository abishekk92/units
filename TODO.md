- [x] InstructionType needs improvement. Ideally there isn't an instruction type, the entrypoint, instruction layout is similar across all runtime. This would make it easy for workflow to be defined in a single place and then be used across all runtimes and going from one runtime to another would be seamless.
- [x] Building on the above point, predictable program layout would mean predictable program interface liek IDL or ABI that the program can expose. This would make it easy to interact with the program from other runtimes or from the outside world. Very crucial for composability.
